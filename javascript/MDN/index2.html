<!--

this enables the javascript to load after the html and the css has loaded&parsed
 Scripts loaded using the async attribute will 
 download the script without blocking the page while the 
 script is being fetched. However, once the download is 
 complete, the script will execute, which blocks the page 
 from rendering. You get no guarantee that scripts will 
 run in any specific order. It is best to use async when 
 the scripts in the page run independently from each other and depend on no other script on the page.

Scripts loaded with the defer attribute 
will load in the order they appear on the page. 
They won't run until the page content has all loaded, 
which is useful if your scripts depend on the DOM being in 
place (e.g. they modify one or more elements on the page).
