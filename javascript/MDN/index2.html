<!-- we can use the extrnal script -->
<!-- <script src="script.js" defer></script> -->
<!-- https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/First_steps/What_is_JavaScript/async-defer.jpg -->

<!-- 
async should be used when you have a bunch of background scripts to load in, 
and you just want to get them in place as soon as possible. For example, maybe you have some game data files to load, 
which will be needed when the game actually begins, but for now you just want to get on with showing the game intro, titles, and lobby, 
without them being blocked by script loading. 
<script async src="js/vendor/jquery.js"></script>

<script async src="js/script2.js"></script>

<script async src="js/script3.js"></script>



Scripts loaded using the defer attribute (see below) will run in the order they appear in the page and execute them as soon as the script and content are downloaded:

<script defer src="js/vendor/jquery.js"></script>

<script defer src="js/script2.js"></script>

<script defer src="js/script3.js"></script>
In the second example, we can be sure that jquery.js will load before script2.js and script3.js and that script2.js 
will load before script3.js. They won't run until the page 
content has all loaded, which is useful if your scripts depend on the DOM being in place (e.g. 
they modify one of more elements on the page).

<script>
    document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', () => {
        function createParagraph() {
            const para = document.createElement('p');
            para.textContent = 'You clicked the button!';
            document.body.appendChild(para);
        }
        /*
          1. Get references to all the buttons on the page in an array format.
          2. Loop through all the buttons and add a click event listener to each one.
            
          When any button is pressed, the createParagraph() function will be run.
        */
        const buttons = document.querySelectorAll('button');

        for (const button of buttons) {
            button.addEventListener('click', createParagraph);
        }
    });

</script>

<!-- 
document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', () => {
  ...
});
this enables the javascript to load after the html and the css has loaded&parsed
 Scripts loaded using the async attribute will 
 download the script without blocking the page while the 
 script is being fetched. However, once the download is 
 complete, the script will execute, which blocks the page 
 from rendering. You get no guarantee that scripts will 
 run in any specific order. It is best to use async when 
 the scripts in the page run independently from each other and depend on no other script on the page.

Scripts loaded with the defer attribute 
will load in the order they appear on the page. 
They won't run until the page content has all loaded, 
which is useful if your scripts depend on the DOM being in 
place (e.g. they modify one or more elements on the page).
