<!-- Remember that all cubic-bezier functions start 
    with p0 at (0, 0) and end with p3 at (1, 1). 
    In this example, the curve moves faster through 
    the Y-axis (starts at 0, goes to p1 y value of 0, 
    then goes to p2 y value of 1) than it moves through 
    the X-axis (0 to start, then 0 for p1, up to 0.58 
    for p2). As a result, the change in the animated 
    element progresses faster than the time of the animation 
    for that segment. Towards the end of the curve, 
    the relationship between the change in x and y 
    values reverses - the y value moves from 1 to 1 
    (no change), and the x values move from 0.58 to 1, 
    making the animation changes progress slower compared 
    to the animation duration. -->
